We
present
an
immersive
multiperson
game
developed
for
testing
models
of
nonverbal
behaviour
in
conversation
People
interact
in
a
virtual
environment
using
avatars
that
are
driven
by
default
by
their
realtime
head
and
hand
movements
However
on
the
press
of
a
button
each
participants
real
movements
can
be
substituted
by
fake
avatar
movements
generated
by
algorithms
The
object
of
the
game
is
to
score
points
in
two
ways
a
by
faking
without
being
detected
and
b
by
detecting
when
others
are
faking
This
enables
what
amounts
to
a
nonverbal
Turing
test
in
which
the
effectiveness
of
different
algorithms
for
controlling
nonverbal
behaviour
can
be
directly
tested
and
evaluated
in
live
interaction
